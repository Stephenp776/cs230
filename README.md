The Gaming Room, a client in this project, sought to develop a multi-platform version of their Android-based game, *Draw It or Lose It*. This game involves teams competing to guess images within timed rounds and was initially limited to the Android platform. The goal was to expand the game to work on additional operating systems, including macOS, Linux, and Windows, while preserving the core gameplay elements, supporting multiple teams and players, and assigning unique identifiers to each player and team. The project required extensive planning to ensure compatibility across platforms and meet The Gaming Room’s requirements for a consistent and familiar user experience.

In developing the design documentation, I focused on detailing constraints and recommendations for achieving seamless cross-platform compatibility. This documentation process clarified the structural requirements needed to maintain consistency in gameplay and user interface, while the recommendation section provided a roadmap for scaling the game’s performance across various platforms. One aspect I feel was done particularly well was the comprehensive breakdown of design constraints and technical recommendations, which offered a clear guide for translating the existing Android functionality to other platforms without sacrificing user experience. Working through the design document also provided valuable insight into structuring code to meet specific multi-platform demands, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing user needs, such as scalability and cross-platform functionality, from the beginning.

If I were to revise any section of the document, I would focus on expanding the "Design Constraints" section to include more technical details on handling platform-specific nuances, providing even greater clarity for developers during implementation. Understanding and addressing The Gaming Room’s needs for a consistent, multi-platform experience was crucial. This focus on user needs guided design choices to create a product that met expectations and delivered a reliable, familiar experience across all platforms. Moving forward, incorporating iterative prototyping and regular feedback loops would further ensure alignment with user needs, as it would support ongoing refinement of requirements and adaptability to evolving expectations. This approach would not only help maintain usability across platforms but also enhance the final product's alignment with client and user goals throughout the development process.
